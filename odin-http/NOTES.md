# Odin HTTP Notes

This was gruelling. Two days of battling compilation erros with Linux and Windows.

Odin is an up-and-comer software development language. I see the value. Execution speed for early stage is commendably performant.

I have not tied this into Howdy World's dashboard, because it's not stable yet. However, I think this will help that OSS move forward and believe that within the year, this will compile smoothly.

If you have ideas how to get Odin HTTP to compile and run, please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).
