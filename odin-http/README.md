# Howdy from ODIN HTTP


## WARNING ##

** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS **

The Odin language is actiely being developed. This uses [Odin HTTP]() which uses OBIO. This will compile and run on the MacOS, but fails in Linux and Windows. I've included the endpoint to help support the Odin community and the Odin HTTP project.

## Build

```bash
bin/build
```

## Run
